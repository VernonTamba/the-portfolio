        Thank you for scrolling down up until the very end. I genuinely
        appreciate your time. I hope you somehow have found this portfolio
        enjoyable to look and read despite of its simplicity and staticness.
        Hopefully, I can become better in the near future and improve this
        portfolio ASAP! This is all from me, much blessings to you!
